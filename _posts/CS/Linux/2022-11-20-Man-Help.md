## 1. Preface

There are tons of commands in Shell prompt. We can google them if it is needed. However, Linux itself provide `help` command for users. Also, `man` command provides more detailed version.

## 2. help

`--help` command gives brief information of the command. It prints brief information at the current terminal.

<div class="notice--primary" markdown="1">

`Command`

```bash
$ [command] --help
```

`Example`

```bash
$ mkdir --help
```

</div>

MacOS does not support `--help` command. Instead, you can use `man` command for more information.
{: .notice--danger}

### 3. man

Unlike `--help` command, `man` opens its page that contains much more information compared to others.

<div class="notice--primary" markdown="1">

`Command`

```bash
$ man [command]
```

`Example`

```bash
$ man mkdir
```

</div>

Usually, information provided by `man` is more than one page. So, it would be better to know some shortcut for easier usage.

|          Shortcut          |           Description            | Remark |
| :------------------------: | :------------------------------: | :----: |
|      `page up` or `b`      |    move to the previous page     |        |
| `page down` or `space bar` |      move to the next page       |        |
|        `/[keyword]`        | search the keyword in the manual |        |
|            `q`             |               quit               |        |
