## 1. Preface

There are many times to reinstall open libraries while using Python. Every time, I have used to search same keyword repeatively. So, in this post, I am going to gather all of them and add whenever new thing appears. You can use search operation(`ctrl + f`) for quick approach.

## 2. Installation

You can use `pip` command instead of `pip3`.
